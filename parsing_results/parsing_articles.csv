Traditional methods include offline manual survey, analytic models based on census data, which are either unable to adapt to the dynamic market or very time consuming. The rapid increase of the availability of big data from various types of mobile devices, such as online query data and offline positioning data, provides us with the possibility to develop automatic and accurate data- driven prediction models for business store site selection. In this paper, we propose a Demand Driven Store Site Selection (DD3S) framework for business store site selection by mining search query data from Baidu Maps. DD3S first detects the spatial-temporal distributions of customer demands on different business services via query data from Baidu Maps, the largest online map search engine in China, and detects the gaps between demand and supply. Then we determine candidate locations via clustering such gaps. In the final stage, we solve the location optimization problem by predicting and ranking the number of customers. We not only deploy supervised regression models to predict the number of customers, but also use learning-to-rank model to directly rank the locations. We evaluate our framework on various types of businesses in real-world cases, and the experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. DD3S as the core function for store site selection has already been implemented as a core component of our business analytics platform and could be potentially used by chain store merchants on Baidu Nuomi.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/S0305-0548(01)00079-X', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1010933404324', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2588555.2612172', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/34.1000236', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDM.2014.18', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2623330.2623675', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869790.1869866', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/5254.708428', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/582415.582418', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2487575.2487616', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1559795.1559835', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2820783.2820876', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1953048.2078195', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2488388.2488480', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767845']"

Specifically, we have a road network on which some clients and servers are located. Each client finds the server that is closest to her for service and her cost of getting served is equal to the (network) distance between the client and the server serving her multiplied by her weight or importance. The optimal location query problem is to find a location for setting up a new server such that the maximum cost of clients being served by the servers (including the new server) is minimized. This problem has been studied before, but the state-of-the-art is still not efficient enough. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for the optimal location query problem, which is based on a novel idea of \emph{nearest location component}. We also discuss three extensions of the optimal location query problem, namely the optimal multiple-location query problem, the optimal location query problem on 3D road networks, and the optimal location query problem with another objective. Extensive experiments were conducted which showed that our algorithms are faster than the state-of-the-art by at least an order of magnitude on large real benchmark datasets. For example, on our largest real datasets, the state-of-the-art ran for more than 10 hours but our algorithm ran within 3 minutes only (i.e., >200 times faster).","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/2350229.2350230', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/261226', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/BF01386390', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11535331_10', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/0020-0190(89)90136-1', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2013.24', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10115-012-0527-4', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2012.45', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.29.4.498', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/1687627.1687754', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00778-011-0230-1', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767845', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2063576.2063788', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1182635.1164183', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767892']"

In this paper, we aim to develop methods for ranking estates based on investment values by mining users' opinions about estates from online user reviews and offline moving behaviors (e.g., Taxi traces, smart card transactions, check-ins). While a variety of features could be extracted from these data, these features are Interco related and redundant. Thus, selecting good features and integrating the feature selection into the fitting of a ranking model are essential. To this end, in this paper, we first strategically mine the fine-grained discrminative features from user reviews and moving behaviors, and then propose a probabilistic sparse pair wise ranking method for estates. Specifically, we first extract the explicit features from online user reviews which express users' opinions about point of interests (POIs) near an estate. We also mine the implicit features from offline moving behaviors from multiple perspectives (e.g., Direction, volume, velocity, heterogeneity, topic, popularity, etc.). Then we learn an estate ranking predictor by combining a pair wise ranking objective and a sparsity regularization in a unified probabilistic framework. And we develop an effective solution for the optimization problem. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation with real world estate related data, and the experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of both features and the proposed model.",[]

While a number of estate appraisal methods have been developed to value real property, the performances of these methods have been limited by the traditional data sources for estate appraisal. However, with the development of new ways of collecting estate-related mobile data, there is a potential to leverage geographic dependencies of estates for enhancing estate appraisal. Indeed, the geographic dependencies of the value of an estate can be from the characteristics of its own neighborhood (individual), the values of its nearby estates (peer), and the prosperity of the affiliated latent business area (zone). To this end, in this paper, we propose a geographic method, named ClusRanking, for estate appraisal by leveraging the mutual enforcement of ranking and clustering power. ClusRanking is able to exploit geographic individual, peer, and zone dependencies in a probabilistic ranking model. Specifically, we first extract the geographic utility of estates from geography data, estimate the neighborhood popularity of estates by mining taxicab trajectory data, and model the influence of latent business areas via ClusRanking. Also, we use a linear model to fuse these three influential factors and predict estate investment values. Moreover, we simultaneously consider individual, peer and zone dependencies, and derive an estate-specific ranking likelihood as the objective function. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with real-world estate related data, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1273496.1273513', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/133160.133199', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/945365.964285', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/65943.65944', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.asoc.2009.12.003', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ipm.2008.11.002', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2487575.2487673', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10791-006-9019-z', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1795114.1795167', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ins.2012.12.002', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1953048.1953057', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1277741.1277809', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2339530.2339561', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2629592', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1148020.1148023']"

With such a query, for instance, a franchise corporation (e.g., McDonald's) can find a location to open a new store such that the number of potential store customers (i.e., people living close to the store) is maximized. Optimal location queries are computationally complex to compute and require efficient solutions that scale with large datasets. Previously, two specific approaches have been proposed for efficient computation of optimal location queries. However, they both assume p-norm distance (namely, L1 and L2/Euclidean); hence, they are not applicable where sites and objects are located on spatial networks. In this paper, we focus on optimal network location (ONL) queries, i.e., optimal location queries with which objects and sites reside on a spatial network. We introduce an approach, namely EONL (short for Expansion-based ONL), which enables efficient computation of ONL queries. Moreover, with an extensive experimental study we verify and compare the efficiency of our proposed approach with real datasets, and we demonstrate the importance of considering network distance (rather than p-norm distance) with ONL queries.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11535331_10', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1315451.1315520', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/1687627.1687754']"

Since all documents are not of equal relevance to their users, highly relevant documents should be identified and ranked first for presentation. In order to develop IR techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. Alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. This article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. The first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. The second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. The third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of IR techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. These novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using TREC data: sample system run results for 20 queries in TREC-7. As a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. The test results indicate that the proposed measures credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences. The graphs based on the measures also provide insight into the performance IR techniques and allow interpretation, for example, from the user point of view.",[]

This problem can be seen as a generalization of the well-studied inconsistent information aggregation problems (e.g. rank aggregation) to probabilistic databases. We consider this problem for various types of queries including SPJ queries, Top-k ranking queries, group-by aggregate queries, and clustering. For different distance metrics, we obtain polynomial time optimal or approximation algorithms for computing the consensus answers (or prove NP-hardness).

Several techniques have been proposed to address OL queries, assuming that all clients and facilities reside in an Lp space. In practice, however, movements between spatial locations are usually confined by the underlying road network, and hence, the actual distance between two locations can differ significantly from their Lp distance. Motivated by the deficiency of the existing techniques, this paper presents the first study on OL queries in road networks.

We review these algorithms and describe a large empirical study comparing several variants in conjunction with a decision tree inducer (three variants) and a Naive-Bayes inducer. The purpose of the study is to improve our understanding of why and when these algorithms, which use perturbation, reweighting, and combination techniques, affect classification error. We provide a bias and variance decomposition of the error to show how different methods and variants influence these two terms. This allowed us to determine that Bagging reduced variance of unstable methods, while boosting methods (AdaBoost and Arc-x4) reduced both the bias and variance of unstable methods but increased the variance for Naive-Bayes, which was very stable. We observed that Arc-x4 behaves differently than AdaBoost if reweighting is used instead of resampling, indicating a fundamental difference. Voting variants, some of which are introduced in this paper, include: pruning versus no pruning, use of probabilistic estimates, weight perturbations (Wagging), and backfitting of data. We found that Bagging improves when probabilistic estimates in conjunction with no-pruning are used, as well as when the data was backfit. We measure tree sizes and show an interesting positive correlation between the increase in the average tree size in AdaBoost trials and its success in reducing the error. We compare the mean-squared error of voting methods to non-voting methods and show that the voting methods lead to large and significant reductions in the mean-squared errors. Practical problems that arise in implementing boosting algorithms are explored, including numerical instabilities and underflows. We use scatterplots that graphically show how AdaBoost reweights instances, emphasizing not only “hard” areas but also outliers and noise.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/922786', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1162/089976698300017197', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1865756.1865765', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1007413511361', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/92571.92640', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1006/inco.1995.1136', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/646943.712093', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1009778005914', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1162/neco.1992.4.1.1', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1022631118932', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645525.757759', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1643031.1643047', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/892585', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645526.756499', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3001460.3001483', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1867135.1867170', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/267553.267557', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645526.657136', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/152181', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1892875.1892983', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3000292.3000308', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3091574.3091606', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645526.657129', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/S0893-6080(05)80023-1']"

We note, however, that the problem of finding good margins is closely related to linear programming, and we use this connection to derive and test new ""LPboosting"" algorithms that achieve better minimum margins than Adaboost.However, these algorithms do not always yield better generalization performance. In fact, more often the opposite is true. We report on a series of controlled experiments which show that no simple version of the minimum-margin story can be complete. We conclude that the crucial question as to why boosting works so well in practice, and how to further improve upon it, remains mostly open.Some of our experiments are interesting for another reason: we show that Adaboost sometimes does overfit--eventually.

The classifier consists of multiple trees constructed systematically by pseudorandomly selecting subsets of components of the feature vector, that is, trees constructed in randomly chosen subspaces. The subspace method is compared to single-tree classifiers and other forest construction methods by experiments on publicly available datasets, where the method's superiority is demonstrated.

Kleinberg'],IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,,https://doi.org/10.1109/34.857004,01 May 2000,19,0,"Stochastic discrimination is a general methodology for constructing classifiers appropriate for pattern recognition. It is based on combining arbitrary numbers of very weak components, which are usually generated by some pseudorandom process, and it has the property that the very complex and accurate classifiers produced in this way retain the ability, characteristic of their weak component pieces, to generalize to new data. In fact, it is often observed, in practice, that classifier performance on test sets continues to rise as more weak components are added, even after performance on training sets seems to have reached a maximum. This is predicted by the underlying theory, for even though the formal error rate on the training set may have reached a minimum, more sophisticated measures intrinsic to this method indicate that classifier performance on both training and test sets continues to improve as complexity increases. In this paper, we begin with a review of the method of stochastic discrimination as applied to pattern recognition. Through a progression of examples keyed to various theoretical issues, we discuss considerations involved with its algorithmic implementation. We then take such an algorithmic implementation and compare its performance, on a large set of standardized pattern recognition problems from the University of California Irvine, and Statlog collections, to many other techniques reported on in the literature, including boosting and bagging. In doing these studies, we compare our results to those reported in the literature by the various authors for the other methods, using the same data and study paradigms used by them. Included in this paper is an outline of the underlying mathematical theory of stochastic discrimination and a remark concerning boosting, which provides a theoretical justification for properties of that method observed in practice, including its ability to generalize.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/221055', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1018054314350', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1006/jcss.1997.1504', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/34.709601', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/844379.844681', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/BF01531079', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/648054.743942', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/212782', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/152181', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1098680']"

The computational requirements for estimating the resultant generalization error on a test set by means of cross-validation are often prohibitive, for leave-one-out cross-validation one needs to train the underlying algorithm on the order of mν times, where m is the size of the training set and ν is the number of replicates. This paper presents several techniques for estimating the generalization error of a bagged learning algorithm without invoking yet more training of the underlying learning algorithm (beyond that of the bagging itself), as is required by cross-validation-based estimation. These techniques all exploit the bias-variance decomposition (Geman, Bienenstock & Doursat, 1992, Wolpert, 1996). The best of our estimators also exploits stacking (Wolpert, 1992). In a set of experiments reported here, it was found to be more accurate than both the alternative cross-validation-based estimator of the bagged algorithm‘s error and the cross-validation-based estimator of the underlying algorithm‘s error. This improvement was particularly pronounced for small test sets. This suggests a novel justification for using bagging—more accurate estimation of the generalization error than is possible without bagging.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1162/neco.1992.4.1.1', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/S0893-6080(05)80023-1', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1162/neco.1997.9.6.1211']"

Given a set O of weighted points and a rectangular region r of a given size, the goal of the MaxRS problem is to find a location of r such that the sum of the weights of all the points covered by r is maximized. This problem is useful in many location-based applications such as finding the best place for a new franchise store with a limited delivery range and finding the most attractive place for a tourist with a limited reachable range. However, the problem has been studied mainly in theory, particularly, in computational geometry. The existing algorithms from the computational geometry community are in-memory algorithms which do not guarantee the scalability. In this paper, we propose a scalable external-memory algorithm (ExactMaxRS) for the MaxRS problem, which is optimal in terms of the I/O complexity. Furthermore, we propose an approximation algorithm (ApproxMaxCRS) for the MaxCRS problem that is a circle version of the MaxRS problem. We prove the correctness and optimality of the ExactMaxRS algorithm along with the approximation bound of the ApproxMaxCRS algorithm. From extensive experimental results, we show that the ExactMaxRS algorithm is two orders of magnitude faster than methods adapted from existing algorithms, and the approximation bound in practice is much better than the theoretical bound of the ApproxMaxCRS algorithm.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645929.758386', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1070432.1070556', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/BF02238188', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.infsof.2006.05.005', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1109557.1109622', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00224-008-9135-9', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.27.7.848', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11535331_10', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/SFCS.1993.366816', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/552315.791170', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/375663.375718', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/647227.719095', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/1921071.1921076', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1989284.1989297', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/1687627.1687754', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1083592.1083701', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767845', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1182635.1164183', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767892']"

Given a set S of sites, a set O of weighted objects, and a spatial region Q, the optimal-location query returns a location in Q with maximum influence. Here the influence of a location l is the total weight of its RNNs, i.e. the total weight of objects in O that are closer to l than to any site in S. This new query has practical applications, but is very challenging to solve. Existing work on computing RNNs assumes a single query location, and thus cannot be used to compute optimal locations. The reason is that there are infinite candidate locations in Q. If we check a finite set of candidate locations, the result can be inaccurate, i.e. the revealed location may not have maximum influence. This paper proposes three methods that accurately compute optimal locations. The first method uses a standard R*-tree. To compute an optimal location, the method retrieves certain objects from the R*-tree and sends them as a stream to a plane-sweep algorithm, which uses a new data structure called the aSB-tree to ensure query efficiency. The second method is based on a new index structure called the OL-tree, which novelly extends the k-d-B-tree to store segmented rectangular records. The OL-tree is only of theoretical usage for it is not space efficient. The most practical approach is based on a new index structure called the Virtual OL-tree. These methods are theoretically and experimentally evaluated.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/261226', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/342009.335415', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/647227.719095', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/223784.223794', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645478.654961', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645927.672207', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1316689.1316754', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645484.656392', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645484.656393']"

Given a set of existing facilities and a set of clients, an OL query asks for a location to build a new facility that optimizes a certain cost metric (defined based on the distances between the clients and the facilities). Several techniques have been proposed to address OL queries, assuming that all clients and facilities reside in an Lp space. In practice, however, movements between spatial locations are usually confined by the underlying road network, and hence, the actual distance between two locations can differ significantly from their Lp distance. Motivated by the deficiency of the existing techniques, this paper presents the first study on OL queries in road networks. We propose a unified framework that addresses three variants of OL queries that find important applications in practice, and we instantiate the framework with several novel query processing algorithms.

Optimal-location queries are important in a lot of real-life applications, such as mobile service planning or resource distribution in an area. Previous studies assume that a client always visits its nearest server, which is too strict to be true in reality. In this paper, we relax this assumption and propose a new model to tackle this problem. We further generalize the problem to finding top-k optimal locations. The main challenge is that, even the fastest approach in existing studies needs to take hours to answer an optimal-location query on a typical real world dataset, which significantly limits the applications of the query. Using our relaxed model, we design an efficient grid-based approximation algorithm called FILM (Fast Influential Location Miner) to the queries, which is orders of magnitude faster than the best-known previous work and the number of clients attracted by a new server in the result location often exceeds 98% of the optimal. The algorithm is extended to finding k influential locations. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the efficiency and effectiveness of FILM on both real and synthetic datasets.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/1687627.1687754', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/93597.98741', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1376616.1376621', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1325851.1325918', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11535331_10', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645927.672207', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1083592.1083701', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1807167.1807174', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1807167.1807206', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/241938.241941']"

Given a set S of sites, a set O of weighted objects, and a spatial region Q, the min-dist optimal-location query returns a location in Q which, if a new site is built there, minimizes the average distance from each object to its closest site. This query can help a franchise (e.g. McDonald's) decide where to put a new store in order to maximize the benefit to its customers. To solve this problem is challenging, for there are theoretically infinite number of locations in Q, all of which could be candidates. This paper first provides a theorem that limits the number of candidate locations without losing the power to find exact answers. Then it provides a progressive algorithm that quickly suggests a location, tells the maximum error it may have, and keeps refining the result. When the algorithm finishes, the exact answer can be found. The intermediate result of early runs can be used to prune the search space for later runs. Crucial to the pruning technique are novel lower-bound estimators. The proposed algorithm, the effect of several optimizations, and the progressiveness are experimentally evaluated.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/261226', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11535331_10', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1023151', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/342009.335415', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11535331_4', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645927.672207', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1316689.1316754']"

This problem assumes that each customer only uses the service provided by his/her nearest service site. However, in reality, a customer tends to go to his/her k nearest service sites. To handle this, MaxBRNN can be extended to the MaxBRkNN problem which finds an optimal region such that setting up a service site in this region guarantees the maximum number of customers who would consider the site as one of their k nearest service locations. We further generalize the MaxBRkNN problem to reflect the real world scenario where customers may have different preferences for different service sites, and at the same time, service sites may have preferred targeted customers. In this paper, we present an efficient solution called MaxFirst to solve this generalized MaxBRkNN problem. The algorithm works by partitioning the space into quadrants and searches only in those quadrants that potentially contain an optimal region. During the space partitioning, we compute the upper and lower bounds of the size of a quadrant's BRkNN, and use these bounds to prune the unpromising quadrants. Experiment results show that MaxFirst can be two to three orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm.",[]

Specifically, we show that anisotropic diffusion can be seen as a robust estimation procedure that estimates a piecewise smooth image from a noisy input image. The &ldquo;edge-stopping&rdquo; function in the anisotropic diffusion equation is closely related to the error norm and influence function in the robust estimation framework. This connection leads to a new &ldquo;edge-stopping&rdquo; function based on Tukey's biweight robust estimator that preserves sharper boundaries than previous formulations and improves the automatic stopping of the diffusion. The robust statistical interpretation also provides a means for detecting the boundaries (edges) between the piecewise smooth regions in an image that has been smoothed with anisotropic diffusion. Additionally, we derive a relationship between anisotropic diffusion and regularization with line processes. Adding constraints on the spatial organization of the line processes allows us to develop new anisotropic diffusion equations that result in a qualitative improvement in the continuity of edges",[]

The model can handle situations where the background of the scene is cluttered and not completely static but contains small motions such as tree branches and bushes. The model estimates the probability of observing pixel intensity values based on a sample of intensity values for each pixel. The model adapts quickly to changes in the scene which enables very sensitive detection of moving targets. We also show how the model can use color information to suppress detection of shadows. The implementation of the model runs in real-time for both gray level and color imagery. Evaluation shows that this approach achieves very sensitive detection with very low false alarm rates.,[]

The input can be in the form of points, or points with an associated tangent or normal, allowing both position and direction to be corrupted by noise. Most approaches treat the problem as an interpolation problem, which is solved by fitting a surface such as a membrane or thin plate to minimize some function. We argue that these physical constraints are not sufficient, and propose to impose additional perceptual constraints such as good continuity and ""cosurfacity."" These constraints allow us to not only infer surfaces, but also to detect surface orientation discontinuities, as well as junctions, all at the same time. The approach imposes no restriction on genus, number of discontinuities, number of objects, and is noniterative. The result is in the form of three dense saliency maps for surfaces, intersections between surfaces (i.e., 3D curves), and 3D junctions, respectively. These saliency maps are then used to guide a ""marching"" process to generate a description (e.g., a triangulated mesh) making information about surfaces, space curves, and 3D junctions explicit. The traditional marching process needs to be refined as the polarity of the surface orientation is not necessarily locally consistent. These three maps are currently not integrated, and this is the topic of our ongoing research.

The filter is noise smoothing and adapts to local changes in image statistics based on a nonstationary mean, nonstationary variance (NMNV) image model. For images degraded by a class of uncorrelated, signal-dependent noise without blur, the adaptive noise smoothing filter becomes a point processor and is similar to Lee's local statistics algorithm [16]. The filter is able to adapt itself to the nonstationary local image statistics in the presence of different types of signal-dependent noise. For multiplicative noise, the adaptive noise smoothing filter is a systematic derivation of Lee's algorithm with some extensions that allow different estimators for the local image variance. The advantage of the derivation is its easy extension to deal with various types of signal-dependent noise. Film-grain and Poisson signal-dependent restoration problems are also considered as examples. All the nonstationary image statistical parameters needed for the filter can be estimated from the noisy image and no a priori information about the original image is required.",[]

This paper presents a summary of the complete system and focuses on two extensions of it that demonstrate its interpretive capacity and applicability to more complex scenes. The first extension provides interpretations of a scene by reasoning about the likelihood of different physical characteristics of simple image regions. The second extension allows the system to handle highlights within the general framework for segmentation.

It describes an algorithm for image segmentation at multiple scales. The detected regions are homogeneous and surrounded by closed edge contours. Previous approaches to multiscale segmentation represent an image at different scales using a scale-space. However, structure is only represented implicitly in this representation, structures at coarser scales are inherently smoothed, and the problem of structure extraction is unaddressed. This paper argues that the issues of scale selection and structure detection cannot be treated separately. A new concept of scale is presented that represents image structures at different scales, and not the image itself. This scale is integrated into a nonlinear transform which makes structure explicit in the transformed domain. Structures that are stable (locally invariant) to changes in scale are identified as being perceptually relevant. The transform can be viewed as collecting spatially distributed evidence for edges and regions, and making it available at contour locations, thereby facilitating integrated detection of edges and regions without restrictive models of geometry or homogeneity. In this sense, it performs Gestalt analysis. All scale parameters of the transform are automatically determined, and the structure of any arbitrary geometry can be identified without any smoothing, even at coarse scales",[]

The mixture distribution is viewed as a contaminated Gaussian density. Using this model and the model-fitting (MF) estimator, we propose a recursive algorithm called the Gaussian mixture density decomposition (GMDD) algorithm for successively identifying each Gaussian component in the mixture. The proposed decomposition scheme has advantages that are desirable but lacking in most existing techniques. In the GMDD algorithm the number of components does not need to be specified a priori, the proportion of noisy data in the mixture can be large, the parameter estimation of each component is virtually initial independent, and the variability in the shape and size of the component densities in the mixture is taken into account. Gaussian mixture density modeling and decomposition has been widely applied in a variety of disciplines that require signal or waveform characterization for classification and recognition. We apply the proposed GMDD algorithm to the identification and extraction of clusters, and the estimation of unknown probability densities. Probability density estimation by identifying a decomposition using the GMDD algorithm, that is, a superposition of normal distributions, is successfully applied to automated cell classification. Computer experiments using both real data and simulated data demonstrate the validity and power of the GMDD algorithm for various models and different noise assumptions",[]

Learning to rank is useful for document retrieval, collaborative filtering, and many other applications. Several methods for learning to rank have been proposed, which take object pairs as 'instances' in learning. We refer to them as the pairwise approach in this paper. Although the pairwise approach offers advantages, it ignores the fact that ranking is a prediction task on list of objects. The paper postulates that learning to rank should adopt the listwise approach in which lists of objects are used as 'instances' in learning. The paper proposes a new probabilistic method for the approach. Specifically it introduces two probability models, respectively referred to as permutation probability and top k probability, to define a listwise loss function for learning. Neural Network and Gradient Descent are then employed as model and algorithm in the learning method. Experimental results on information retrieval show that the proposed listwise approach performs better than the pairwise approach.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/553876', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1102351.1102363', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1148170.1148205', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1273496.1273513', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/302528.302736', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645527.756505', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/188490.188557', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/345508.345545', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/299094.299104', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/775047.775067', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645531.655830', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1008992.1009006', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1277741.1277791', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1277741.1277808']"

The goodness of a model is usually evaluated with performance measures such as MAP (Mean Average Precision) and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain). Ideally a learning algorithm would train a ranking model that could directly optimize the performance measures with respect to the training data. Existing methods, however, are only able to train ranking models by minimizing loss functions loosely related to the performance measures. For example, Ranking SVM and RankBoost train ranking models by minimizing classification errors on instance pairs. To deal with the problem, we propose a novel learning algorithm within the framework of boosting, which can minimize a loss function directly defined on the performance measures. Our algorithm, referred to as AdaRank, repeatedly constructs 'weak rankers' on the basis of reweighted training data and finally linearly combines the weak rankers for making ranking predictions. We prove that the training process of AdaRank is exactly that of enhancing the performance measure used. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that AdaRank significantly outperforms the baseline methods of BM25, Ranking SVM, and RankBoost.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/553876', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1102351.1102363', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1148170.1148205', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11776420_44', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1013685603443', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/945365.964285', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1006/jcss.1997.1504', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2976456.2976481', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/188490.188557', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/345508.345545', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/775047.775067', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1102351.1102399', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/383952.383970', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1008992.1009006', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/290941.291008', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1076034.1076105', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645526.657129', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1007614523901', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10791-005-6991-7', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11871842_86', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1076034.1076068', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1081870.1081911']"

In this paper, we propose a framework (titled DRoF) that Discovers Regions of different Functions in a city using both human mobility among regions and points of interests (POIs) located in a region. Specifically, we segment a city into disjointed regions according to major roads, such as highways and urban express ways. We infer the functions of each region using a topic-based inference model, which regards a region as a document, a function as a topic, categories of POIs (e.g., restaurants and shopping malls) as metadata (like authors, affiliations, and key words), and human mobility patterns (when people reach/leave a region and where people come from and leave for) as words. As a result, a region is represented by a distribution of functions, and a function is featured by a distribution of mobility patterns. We further identify the intensity of each function in different locations. The results generated by our framework can benefit a variety of applications, including urban planning, location choosing for a business, and social recommendations. We evaluated our method using large-scale and real-world datasets, consisting of two POI datasets of Beijing (in 2010 and 2011) and two 3-month GPS trajectory datasets (representing human mobility) generated by over 12,000 taxicabs in Beijing in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The results justify the advantages of our approach over baseline methods solely using POIs or human mobility.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2133806.2133826', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/944919.944937', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020523', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1835804.1835918', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/34.161346', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020571', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2063212.2063223', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/558008', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1999320.1999331', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1963405.1963443', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020462', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2030112.2030128', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2030112.2030126', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2124413']"

Urban computing aims to tackle these issues by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning, transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban data visualization.

In contrast to previous methods which rely on labeled images provided by the user, this article attempts to enhance the performance of relevance feedback by exploiting unlabeled images existing in the database. Concretely, this article integrates the merits of semisupervised learning and active learning into the relevance feedback process. In detail, in each round of relevance feedback two simple learners are trained from the labeled data, that is, images from user query and user feedback. Each learner then labels some unlabeled images in the database for the other learner. After retraining with the additional labeled data, the learners reclassify the images in the database and then their classifications are merged. Images judged to be positive with high confidence are returned as the retrieval result, while those judged with low confidence are put into the pool which is used in the next round of relevance feedback. Experiments show that using semisupervised learning and active learning simultaneously in CBIR is beneficial, and the proposed method achieves better performance than some existing methods.",[]

Given a set S of sites, a set O of weighted objects, and a spatial region Q, the optimal-location query returns a location in Q with maximum influence. Here the influence of a location l is the total weight of its RNNs, i.e. the total weight of objects in O that are closer to l than to any site in S. This new query has practical applications, but is very challenging to solve. Existing work on computing RNNs assumes a single query location, and thus cannot be used to compute optimal locations. The reason is that there are infinite candidate locations in Q. If we check a finite set of candidate locations, the result can be inaccurate, i.e. the revealed location may not have maximum influence. This paper proposes three methods that accurately compute optimal locations. The first method uses a standard R*-tree. To compute an optimal location, the method retrieves certain objects from the R*-tree and sends them as a stream to a plane-sweep algorithm, which uses a new data structure called the aSB-tree to ensure query efficiency. The second method is based on a new index structure called the OL-tree, which novelly extends the k-d-B-tree to store segmented rectangular records. The OL-tree is only of theoretical usage for it is not space efficient. The most practical approach is based on a new index structure called the Virtual OL-tree. These methods are theoretically and experimentally evaluated.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/261226', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/342009.335415', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/647227.719095', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/223784.223794', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645478.654961', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645927.672207', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1316689.1316754', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645484.656392', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645484.656393']"

These frameworks are successfully applied to the most popular spatial queries, namely nearest neighbors, range search, closest pairs and e-distance joins, in the context of spatial network databases.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/88636.88888', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645924.671340', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/93597.98741', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/170035.170075', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/80156', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/342009.335414', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/BF01386390', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/191839.191925', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/647227.719234', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/602259.602266', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/238355.238497', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320248.320255', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/155271.155273', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645477.654629', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/69.687976', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645481.655601', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/21004.21035', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/377296', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/276305.276319', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/585147.585167', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/69.567054', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645914.671636']"

In this paper, we study a related problem called MaxBRNN: find an optimal region that maximizes the size of BRNNs. Such a problem has many real life applications, including the problem of finding a new server point that attracts as many customers as possible by proximity. A straightforward approach is to determine the BRNNs for all possible points that are not feasible since there are a large (or infinite) number of possible points. To the best of our knowledge, the fastest known method has exponential time complexity on the data size. Based on some interesting properties of the problem, we come up with an efficient algorithm called MaxOverlap. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our algorithm is many times faster than the best-known technique.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/338219.338629', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/93597.98741', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1137/0215051', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/S0019-9958(86)80030-4', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/261226', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11535331_10', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/342009.335415', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645927.672207', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1376616.1376621', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/1687627.1687754', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1325851.1325918', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1083592.1083701', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1182635.1164183']"

A controlled study using three classifiers, kNN, LLSF and WORD, was conducted to examine the impact of configuration variations in five versions of Reuters on the observed performance of classifiers. Analysis and empirical evidence suggest that the evaluation results on some versions of Reuters were significantly affected by the inclusion of a large portion of unlabelled documents, mading those results difficult to interpret and leading to considerable confusions in the literature. Using the results evaluated on the other versions of Reuters which exclude the unlabelled documents, the performance of twelve methods are compared directly or indirectly. For indirect compararions, kNN, LLSF and WORD were used as baselines, since they were evaluated on all versions of Reuters that exclude the unlabelled documents. As a global observation, kNN, LLSF and a neural network method had the best performance; except for a Naive Bayes approach, the other learning algorithms also performed relatively well.",[]

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems.

In this paper, we present a location-based and preference-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (such as restaurants) within a geospatial range with the consideration of both: 1) User preferences, which are automatically learned from her location history and 2) Social opinions, which are mined from the location histories of the local experts. This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near their living areas but also to a city that is new to them. As a user can only visit a limited number of locations, the user-locations matrix is very sparse, leading to a big challenge to traditional collaborative filtering-based location recommender systems. The problem becomes even more challenging when people travel to a new city. To this end, we propose a novel location recommender system, which consists of two main parts: offline modeling and online recommendation. The offline modeling part models each individual's personal preferences with a weighted category hierarchy (WCH) and infers the expertise of each user in a city with respect to different category of locations according to their location histories using an iterative learning model. The online recommendation part selects candidate local experts in a geospatial range that matches the user's preferences using a preference-aware candidate selection algorithm and then infers a score of the candidate locations based on the opinions of the selected local experts. Finally, the top-k ranked locations are returned as the recommendations for the user. We evaluated our system with a large-scale real dataset collected from Foursquare. The results confirm that our method offers more effective recommendations than baselines, while having a good efficiency of providing location recommendations.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ins.2007.07.024', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1571941.1572033', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/1920841.1920968', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00087-7', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020579', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1867699.1867706', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1864349.1864380', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/312624.312682', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/SAINT.2006.55', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/324133.324140', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1629890.1629893', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/245108.245126', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2012.54', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1458082.1458205', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2391319.2391438', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/564376.564421', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869790.1869861', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2009916.2009962', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1772690.1772795', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2124413', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1889681.1889683', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1921591.1921596', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1526709.1526816']"

Since all documents are not of equal relevance to their users, highly relevant documents should be identified and ranked first for presentation. In order to develop IR techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. Alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. This article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. The first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. The second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. The third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of IR techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. These novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using TREC data: sample system run results for 20 queries in TREC-7. As a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. The test results indicate that the proposed measures credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences. The graphs based on the measures also provide insight into the performance IR techniques and allow interpretation, for example, from the user point of view.",[]

However, selecting the best fare for each individual traveller's needs is a complex process that is left almost completely unaided. By examining the relation between urban mobility and fare purchasing habits in large datasets from London, England's public transport network, we estimate that travellers in the city cumulatively spend, per year, up to approximately GBP 200 million more than they need to, as a result of purchasing the incorrect fares. We propose to address these incorrect purchases by leveraging the huge volumes of data that travellers create as they move about the city, by providing, to each of them, personalised ticket recommendations based on their estimated future travel patterns. In this work, we explore the viability of building a fare-recommendation system for public transport networks by (a) formalising the problem as two separate prediction problems and (b) evaluating a number of algorithms that aim to match travellers to the best fare. We find that applying data mining techniques to public transport data has the potential to provide travellers with substantial savings.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/367766.368168', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1644517.1644676', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1622737.1622742', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1656274.1656278', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1753326.1753597', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1650083.1650092', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/956750.956767', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/2.666847', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1941884', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDM.2010.152']"

Historically, researchers have established a link between well-being and visibility of city neighbourhoods and have measured visibility via quantitative studies with willing participants, a process that is invariably manual and cumbersome. However, the influx of the world's population into urban centres now calls for methods that can easily be implemented, scaled, and analysed. We propose that one such method is offered by pervasive technology: we test whether urban mobility--as measured by public transport fare collection sensors--is a viable proxy for the visibility of a city's communities. We validate this hypothesis by examining the correlation between London urban flow of public transport and census-based indices of the well-being of London's census areas. We find that not only are the two correlated, but a number of insights into the flow between areas of varying social standing can be uncovered with readily available transport data. For example, we find that deprived areas tend to preferentially attract people living in other deprived areas, suggesting a segregation effect.",[]

The combination of mobile phones and recommender systems can change the way one deals with such abundance. Mobile phones with positioning technology are now widely available, making it easy for people to broadcast their whereabouts, recommender systems can now identify patterns in people’s movements in order to, for example, recommend events. To do so, the system relies on having mobile users who share their attendance at a large number of social events: cold-start users, who have no location history, cannot receive recommendations. We set out to address the mobile cold-start problem by answering the following research question: how can social events be recommended to a cold-start user based only on his home location? To answer this question, we carry out a study of the relationship between preferences for social events and geography, the first of its kind in a large metropolitan area. We sample location estimations of one million mobile phone users in Greater Boston, combine the sample with social events in the same area, and infer the social events attended by 2,519 residents. Upon this data, we test a variety of algorithms for recommending social events. We find that the most effective algorithm recommends events that are popular among residents of an area. The least effective, instead, recommends events that are geographically close to the area. This last result has interesting implications for location-based services that emphasize recommending nearby events.",[]

In this paper, we propose a framework (titled DRoF) that Discovers Regions of different Functions in a city using both human mobility among regions and points of interests (POIs) located in a region. Specifically, we segment a city into disjointed regions according to major roads, such as highways and urban express ways. We infer the functions of each region using a topic-based inference model, which regards a region as a document, a function as a topic, categories of POIs (e.g., restaurants and shopping malls) as metadata (like authors, affiliations, and key words), and human mobility patterns (when people reach/leave a region and where people come from and leave for) as words. As a result, a region is represented by a distribution of functions, and a function is featured by a distribution of mobility patterns. We further identify the intensity of each function in different locations. The results generated by our framework can benefit a variety of applications, including urban planning, location choosing for a business, and social recommendations. We evaluated our method using large-scale and real-world datasets, consisting of two POI datasets of Beijing (in 2010 and 2011) and two 3-month GPS trajectory datasets (representing human mobility) generated by over 12,000 taxicabs in Beijing in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The results justify the advantages of our approach over baseline methods solely using POIs or human mobility.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2133806.2133826', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/944919.944937', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020523', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1835804.1835918', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/34.161346', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020571', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2063212.2063223', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/558008', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1999320.1999331', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1963405.1963443', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020462', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2030112.2030128', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2030112.2030126', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2124413']"

While many techniques exist to identify such tuples, the merging or elimination of duplicates can be a difficult task that relies on ad-hoc and often manual solutions. We propose a complementary approach that permits declarative query answering over duplicated data, where each duplicate is associated with a probability of being in the clean database. We rewrite queries over a database containing duplicates to return each answer with the probability that the answer is in the clean database. Our rewritten queries are sensitive to the semantics of duplication and help a user understand which query answers are most likely to be present in the clean database. The semantics that we adopt is independent of the way the probabilities are produced, but is able to effectively exploit them during query answering. In the absence of external knowledge that associates each database tuple with a probability, we offer a technique, based on tuple summaries, that automates this task. We experimentally study the performance of our rewritten queries. Our studies show that the rewriting does not introduce a significant overhead in query execution time.

A centralized database tracks these entities to enable query processing. Due to continuous changes in these values and limited resources (e.g., network bandwidth and battery power), it is often infeasible to store the exact values at all times. A similar situation exists for moving object environments that track the constantly changing locations of objects. In this environment, it is possible for database queries to produce incorrect or invalid results based upon old data. However, if the degree of error (or uncertainty) between the actual value and the database value is controlled, one can place more confidence in the answers to queries. More generally, query answers can be augmented with probabilistic estimates of the validity of the answers. In this paper we study probabilistic query evaluation based upon uncertain data. A classification of queries is made based upon the nature of the result set. For each class, we develop algorithms for computing probabilistic answers. We address the important issue of measuring the quality of the answers to these queries, and provide algorithms for efficiently pulling data from relevant sensors or moving objects in order to improve the quality of the executing queries. Extensive experiments are performed to examine the effectiveness of several data update policies.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/304182.304207', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/376868.376902', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/276304.276334', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/375551.375577', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/375663.375710', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645926.671877', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/564691.564701', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TC.2002.1039840', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1102016', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/0164-1212(94)90046-9', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1008782710752']"

The problem of efficiently answering such ranking queries has been studied and analyzed extensively within traditional database settings. The importance of the top-k is perhaps even greater in probabilistic databases, where a relation can encode exponentially many possible worlds. There have been several recent attempts to propose definitions and algorithms for ranking queries over probabilistic data. However, these all lack many of the intuitive properties of a top-k over deterministic data. Specifically, we define a number of fundamental properties, including exact-k, containment, unique-rank, value-invariance, and stability, which are all satisfied by ranking queries on certain data. We argue that all these conditions should also be fulfilled by any reasonable definition for ranking uncertain data. Unfortunately, none of the existing definitions is able to achieve this. To remedy this shortcoming, this work proposes an intuitive new approach of expected rank. This uses the well-founded notion of the expected rank of each tuple across all possible worlds as the basis of the ranking. We are able to prove that, in contrast to all existing approaches, the expected rank satisfies all the required properties for a ranking query. We provide efficient solutions to compute this ranking across the major models of uncertain data, such as attribute-level and tuple-level uncertainty. For an uncertain relation of N tuples, the processing cost is O(N logN)—no worse than simply sorting the relation. In settings where there is a high cost for generating each tuple in turn, we provide pruning techniques based on probabilistic tail bounds that can terminate the search early and guarantee that the top-k has been found. Finally, a comprehensive experimental study confirms the effectiveness of our approach.",[]

Finally, we show that for some semirings containment of conjunctive queries is the same as for standard set semantics.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/551350', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/153724.153752', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1182635.1164209', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/256303.256306', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/383721.383725', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645504.656274', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800105.803397', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1182635.1164136', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645499.655751', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/935619', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/357775.357777', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1316689.1316764', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/215206.215372', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/239041.239045', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11896548_24', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1634.1886', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/211414.211419', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/275487.275511', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/267846.267855', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/261124.261131', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/200616.200642', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/145471', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645916.671834', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/322217.322221', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2006.174', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/533142', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/S0304-3975(96)00129-6']"

Probabilities of complex events can be computed from those of basic events on which they depend, using any of a number of strategies. Which strategy is appropriate depends very much on the known interdependencies among the events involved. Previous work on probabilistic databases has assumed a fixed and restrictivecombination strategy (e.g., assuming all events are pairwise independent). In this article, we characterize, using postulates, whole classes of strategies for conjunction, disjunction, and negation, meaningful from the viewpoint of probability theory. (1) We propose a probabilistic relational data model and a genericprobabilistic relational algebra that neatly captures various strategiessatisfying the postulates, within a single unified framework. (2) We show that as long as the chosen strategies can be computed in polynomial time, queries in the positive fragment of the probabilistic relational algebra have essentially the same data complexity as classical relational algebra. (3) We establish various containments and equivalences between algebraic expressions, similar in spirit to those in classical algebra. (4) We develop algorithms for maintaining materialized probabilistic views. (5) Based on these ideas, we have developed a prototype probabilistic database system called ProbView on top of Dbase V.0. We validate our complexity results with experiments and show that rewriting certain types of queries to other equivalent forms often yields substantial savings.",[]

Our contribution consists in devising a special way of handling blossoms, which enables an O(|E|) implementation of a phase. In each phase, the algorithm grows Breadth First Search trees at all unmatched vertices. When it detects the presence of a blossom, it does not 'shrink' the blossom immediately. Instead, it delays the shrinking in such a way that the first augmenting path found is of minimum length. Furthermore, it achieves the effect of shrinking a blossom by a special labeling procedure which enables it to find an augmenting path through a blossom quickly.",[]

In this paper we propose an alternative approach to materializing probabilistic views, by giving conditions under which a view can be represented by a block-independent disjoint (BID) table. Not all views can be represented as BID tables and so we propose a novel partial representation that can represent all views but may not define a unique probability distribution. We then give conditions on when a query's value on a partial representation will be uniquely defined. We apply our theory to two applications: query processing using views and information exchange using views. In query processing on probabilistic data, we can ignore the lineage and use materialized views to more efficiently answer queries. By contrast, if the view has explicit lineage, the query evaluation must reprocess the lineage to compute the query resulting in dramatically slower execution. The second application is information exchange when we do not wish to disclose the entire lineage, which otherwise may result in shipping the entire database. The paper contains several theoretical results that completely solve the problem of deciding whether a conjunctive view can be represented as a BID and whether a query on a partial representation is uniquely determined. We validate our approach experimentally showing that representable views exist in real and synthetic workloads and show over three magnitudes of improvement in query processing versus a lineage based approach.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/275487.275516', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/551350', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2006.35', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/69.166990', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1066157.1066277', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1142473.1142534', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645480.655434', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/872757.872823', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645927.672216', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00778-002-0083-8', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1316689.1316764', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1265530.1265531', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2006.174', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1316689.1316741', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645925.756643', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1597348.1597430', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/375663.375706', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1182635.1164210', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s007780100054', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/261124.261131', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1142351.1142375', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1007568.1007633', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988672.988687', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/767141.767146', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDMW.2007.82', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645502.656100']"

Complete models are theoretically attractive, but they can be nonintuitive and more complex than necessary for many applications. To address this tension, we propose a two-layer approach to managing uncertain data: an underlying logical model that is complete, and one or more working models that are easier to understand, visualize, and query, but may lose some information. We explore the space of incomplete working models, place several of them in a strict hierarchy based on expressive power, and study their closure properties.

There is a growing need for database management systems that can efficiently represent and query such data. In this work, we show how data characteristics can be leveraged to make the query evaluation process more efficient. In particular, we exploit what we refer to as shared correlations where the same uncertainties and correlations occur repeatedly in the data. Shared correlations occur mainly due to two reasons: (1) Uncertainty and correlations usually come from general statistics and rarely vary on a tuple-to-tuple basis; (2) The query evaluation procedure itself tends to re-introduce the same correlations. Prior work has shown that the query evaluation problem on probabilistic databases is equivalent to a probabilistic inference problem on an appropriately constructed probabilistic graphical model (PGM). We leverage this by introducing a new data structure, called the random variable elimination graph (rv-elim graph) that can be built from the PGM obtained from query evaluation. We develop techniques based on bisimulation that can be used to compress the rv-elim graph exploiting the presence of shared correlations in the PGM, the compressed rv-elim graph can then be used to run inference. We validate our methods by evaluating them empirically and show that even with a few shared correlations significant speed-ups are possible.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2006.35', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3765.3773', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1182635.1164209', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1247480.1247558', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/872757.872823', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1316689.1316764', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497511', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1642293.1642503', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1316689.1316741', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/647770.734268', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/646307.687770', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/239041.239045', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/944919.944950', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1296231', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1182635.1164210', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/800221.806724', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1137/0216062', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1630659.1630801', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1325851.1325861', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/929082', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497514']"

We define the locality gap of a local search procedure for a minimization problem as the maximum ratio of a locally optimum solution (obtained using this procedure) to the global optimum. For k-median, we show that local search with swaps has a locality gap of 5. Furthermore, if we permit up to p facilities to be swapped simultaneously, then the locality gap is 3+2/p. This is the first analysis of a local search for k-median that provides a bounded performance guarantee with only k medians. This also improves the previous known 4 approximation for this problem. For uncapacitated facility location, we show that local search, which permits adding, dropping, and swapping a facility, has a locality gap of 3. This improves the bound of 5 given by M. Korupolu, C. Plaxton, and R. Rajaraman [Analysis of a Local Search Heuristic for Facility Location Problems, Technical Report 98-30, DIMACS, 1998]. We also consider a capacitated facility location problem where each facility has a capacity and we are allowed to open multiple copies of a facility. For this problem we introduce a new local search operation which opens one or more copies of a facility and drops zero or more facilities. We prove that this local search has a locality gap between 3 and 4.",[]

GNG query is a partition-based clustering problem which can be found in many real applications and is NP-hard. In this paper, Exhaustive Hierarchical Combination (EHC) algorithm and Subset Hierarchial Refinement (SHR) algorithm are developed for GNG query processing. While EHC is capable to provide the optimal solution for k=2, SHR is an efficient approximate approach that combines database techniques with local search heuristic. The processing focus of our approaches is on minimizing the access and evaluation of subsets of cardinality k in D since the number of such subsets is exponentially greater than \vert D\vert. To do that, the hierarchical blocks of data points at high level are used to find an intermediate solution and then refined by following the guided search direction at low level so as to prune irrelevant subsets. The comprehensive experiments on both real and synthetic data sets demonstrate the superiority of SHR in terms of efficiency and quality.",[]

It is a fundamental pre-processing step for many applications, such as moving object management, traffic flow analysis, and driving directions. In practice there exists huge amount of low-sampling-rate (e.g., one point every 2--5 minutes) GPS trajectories. Unfortunately, most current map-matching approaches only deal with high-sampling-rate (typically one point every 10--30s) GPS data, and become less effective for low-sampling-rate points as the uncertainty in data increases. In this paper, we propose a novel global map-matching algorithm called ST-Matching for low-sampling-rate GPS trajectories. ST-Matching considers (1) the spatial geometric and topological structures of the road network and (2) the temporal/speed constraints of the trajectories. Based on spatio-temporal analysis, a candidate graph is constructed from which the best matching path sequence is identified. We compare ST-Matching with the incremental algorithm and Average-Fréchet-Distance (AFD) based global map-matching algorithm. The experiments are performed both on synthetic and real dataset. The results show that our ST-matching algorithm significantly outperform incremental algorithm in terms of matching accuracy for low-sampling trajectories. Meanwhile, when compared with AFD-based global algorithm, ST-Matching also improves accuracy as well as running time.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/S0196-6774(03)00085-3', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1083592.1083691', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cor.2005.03.027', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1070432.1070455', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1325851.1325942', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/0895-7177(95)00146-S', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/238355.238550', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1784462.1784487', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/647226.719082', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1376616.1376623', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/SSDBM.2006.11', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/998688.1007156', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2009.50', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2008.20']"

The knowledge can be used to suggest cost-efficient driving routes as well as identifying road segments where gas has been wasted significantly. The instant estimation of the emissions from vehicles can enable pollution alerts and help diagnose the root cause of air pollution in the long run. In our method, we first compute the travel speed of each road segment using the GPS trajectories received recently. As many road segments are not traversed by trajectories (i.e., data sparsity), we propose a Travel Speed Estimation (TSE) model based on a context-aware matrix factorization approach. TSE leverages features learned from other data sources, e.g., map data and historical trajectories, to deal with the data sparsity problem. We then propose a Traffic Volume Inference (TVI) model to infer the number of vehicles passing each road segment per minute. TVI is an unsupervised Bayesian Network that incorporates multiple factors, such as travel speed, weather conditions and geographical features of a road. Given the travel speed and traffic volume of a road segment, gas consumption and emissions can be calculated based on existing environmental theories. We evaluate our method based on extensive experiments using GPS trajectories generated by over 32,000 taxis in Beijing over a period of two months. The results demonstrate the advantages of our method over baselines, validating the contribution of its components and finding interesting discoveries for the benefit of society.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1397705.1397713', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1653771.1653820', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2461912.2462021', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869790.1869807', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1594977.1592600', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TMC.2012.205', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2642650']"

This is very important in modern car navigation systems as it helps drivers to make sensible decisions. To our best knowledge, there is no efficient system/solution that can offer affordable costs at both client and server sides for online shortest path computation. Unfortunately, the conventional client-server architecture scales poorly with the number of clients. A promising approach is to let the server collect live traffic information and then broadcast them over radio or wireless network. This approach has excellent scalability with the number of clients. Thus, we develop a new framework called live traffic index (LTI)which enables drivers to quickly and effectively collect the live traffic information on the broadcasting channel. An impressive result is that the driver can compute/update their shortest path result by receiving only a small fraction of the index. Our experimental study shows that LTI is robust to various parameters and it offers relatively short tune-in cost (at client side), fast query response time (at client side), small broadcast size (at server side), and light maintenance time (at server side)for online shortest path problem.",[]

This survey also introduces the methods that transform trajectories into other data formats, such as graphs, matrices, and tensors, to which more data mining and machine learning techniques can be applied.

CSP combines signals based on location and user trajectories (using WiFi/GPS) along with various visual and audio place ""hints"" mined from opportunistic sensor data. Place hints include words spoken by people, text written on signs or objects recognized in the environment.

In this paper, we propose new techniques based on clustering and regression for analyzing anonymized cellular network data to identify generally important locations, and to discern semantically meaningful locations such as home and work. Starting with temporally sparse and spatially coarse location information, we propose a new algorithm to identify important locations. We test this algorithm on arbitrary cellphone users, including those with low call rates, and find that we are within 3 miles of ground truth for 88% of volunteer users. Further, after locating home and work, we achieve commute distance estimates that are within 1 mile of equivalent estimates derived from government census data.

Consequently, information customized to their locations, such as nearest points of interest can be provided. However, there is a major privacy concern over sharing such sensitive information with potentially malicious servers, jeopardizing users' private information. The anonymity- and cloaking-based approaches proposed to address this problem cannot provide stringent privacy guarantees without incurring costly computation and communication overhead. Furthermore, they require a trusted intermediate anonymizer to protect user locations during query processing. This paper proposes a fundamental approach based on private information retrieval to process range and K-nearest neighbor queries, the prevalent queries used in many location-based services, with stronger privacy guarantees compared to those of the cloaking and anonymity approaches.

This trend is now impacting location sharing applications (LSAs) such that users are sharing their location data with a much wider and more diverse audience. In this paper, we describe this as social-driven sharing, distinguishing it from past examples of what we refer to as purpose-driven location sharing. We explore the differences between these two types of sharing by conducting a comparative two-week study with nine participants. We found significant differences in terms of users' decisions about what location information to share, their privacy concerns, and how privacy-preserving their disclosures were. Based on these results, we provide design implications for future LSAs.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1357054.1357134', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/985921.986043', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1771592.1771613', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1054972.1054985', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/B:BTTJ.0000047585.06264.cc', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1241867.1241879', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1102199.1102214', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1771592.1771598', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11551201_13', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1073001.1073008', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/765891.765952', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1864349.1864362', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358916.358975', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1085777.1085805', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1054972.1054987', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11748625_3', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00779-008-0214-3', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/365024.365105']"

Through our analysis on a dataset collected from Foursquare, a popular location-based social networking system, we observe that there exists strong social and geospatial ties among users and their favorite locations/places in the system. Accordingly, we develop a friend-based collaborative filtering (FCF) approach for location recommendation based on collaborative ratings of places made by social friends. Moreover, we propose a variant of FCF technique, namely Geo-Measured FCF (GM-FCF), based on heuristics derived from observed geospatial characteristics in the Foursquare dataset. Finally, the evaluation results show that the proposed family of FCF techniques holds comparable recommendation effectiveness against the state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms, while incurring significantly lower computational overhead.

Such real-world location histories imply, to some extent, users' interests in places, and bring us opportunities to understand the correlation between users and locations. In this article, we move towards this direction and report on a personalized friend and location recommender for the geographical information systems (GIS) on the Web. First, in this recommender system, a particular individual's visits to a geospatial region in the real world are used as their implicit ratings on that region. Second, we measure the similarity between users in terms of their location histories and recommend to each user a group of potential friends in a GIS community. Third, we estimate an individual's interests in a set of unvisited regions by involving his/her location history and those of other users. Some unvisited locations that might match their tastes can be recommended to the individual. A framework, referred to as a hierarchical-graph-based similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed to uniformly model each individual's location history, and effectively measure the similarity among users. In this framework, we take into account three factors: 1) the sequence property of people's outdoor movements, 2) the visited popularity of a geospatial region, and 3) the hierarchical property of geographic spaces. Further, we incorporated a content-based method into a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which uses HGSM as the user similarity measure, to estimate the rating of a user on an item. We evaluated this recommender system based on the GPS data collected by 75 subjects over a period of 1 year in the real world. As a result, HGSM outperforms related similarity measures, namely similarity-by-count, cosine similarity, and Pearson similarity measures. Moreover, beyond the item-based CF method and random recommendations, our system provides users with more attractive locations and better user experiences of recommendation.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TKDE.2005.99', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/304182.304187', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00779-003-0240-0', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/371920.372071', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/245108.245124', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1297231.1297256', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2074094.2074100', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1807167.1807197', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1341012.1341026', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1242572.1242610', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/138859.138867', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1281192.1281230', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/315149.315352', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/860435.860483', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/SAINT.2006.55', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/582415.582418', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11853565_15', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MC.2007.141', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ipm.2006.07.005', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1463434.1463477', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1597148.1597206', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MIC.2003.1167344', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1463434.1463477', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/777092.777124', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645527.657289', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1006544522159', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192844.192905', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/223904.223931', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1081870.1081956', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11833529_64', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1297231.1297265', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11853565_13', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2008.24', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1244468.1244610', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1772690.1772795', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2010.42', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1889681.1889683', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1658373.1658374', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2009.50', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1409635.1409677', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1367497.1367532', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2008.20', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1526709.1526816']"

In this paper, we present a location-based and preference-aware recommender system that offers a particular user a set of venues (such as restaurants) within a geospatial range with the consideration of both: 1) User preferences, which are automatically learned from her location history and 2) Social opinions, which are mined from the location histories of the local experts. This recommender system can facilitate people's travel not only near their living areas but also to a city that is new to them. As a user can only visit a limited number of locations, the user-locations matrix is very sparse, leading to a big challenge to traditional collaborative filtering-based location recommender systems. The problem becomes even more challenging when people travel to a new city. To this end, we propose a novel location recommender system, which consists of two main parts: offline modeling and online recommendation. The offline modeling part models each individual's personal preferences with a weighted category hierarchy (WCH) and infers the expertise of each user in a city with respect to different category of locations according to their location histories using an iterative learning model. The online recommendation part selects candidate local experts in a geospatial range that matches the user's preferences using a preference-aware candidate selection algorithm and then infers a score of the candidate locations based on the opinions of the selected local experts. Finally, the top-k ranked locations are returned as the recommendations for the user. We evaluated our system with a large-scale real dataset collected from Foursquare. The results confirm that our method offers more effective recommendations than baselines, while having a good efficiency of providing location recommendations.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ins.2007.07.024', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1571941.1572033', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/1920841.1920968', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/S0169-7552(98)00087-7', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020579', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1867699.1867706', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1864349.1864380', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/312624.312682', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/SAINT.2006.55', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/324133.324140', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1629890.1629893', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/245108.245126', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2012.54', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1458082.1458205', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2391319.2391438', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/564376.564421', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869790.1869861', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2009916.2009962', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1772690.1772795', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2124413', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1889681.1889683', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1921591.1921596', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1526709.1526816']"

In order to develop IR techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. Alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. This article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. The first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. The second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. The third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of IR techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. These novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using TREC data: sample system run results for 20 queries in TREC-7. As a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. The test results indicate that the proposed measures credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences. The graphs based on the measures also provide insight into the performance IR techniques and allow interpretation, for example, from the user point of view.",[]

However, selecting the best fare for each individual traveller's needs is a complex process that is left almost completely unaided. By examining the relation between urban mobility and fare purchasing habits in large datasets from London, England's public transport network, we estimate that travellers in the city cumulatively spend, per year, up to approximately GBP 200 million more than they need to, as a result of purchasing the incorrect fares. We propose to address these incorrect purchases by leveraging the huge volumes of data that travellers create as they move about the city, by providing, to each of them, personalised ticket recommendations based on their estimated future travel patterns. In this work, we explore the viability of building a fare-recommendation system for public transport networks by (a) formalising the problem as two separate prediction problems and (b) evaluating a number of algorithms that aim to match travellers to the best fare. We find that applying data mining techniques to public transport data has the potential to provide travellers with substantial savings.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/367766.368168', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1644517.1644676', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1622737.1622742', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1656274.1656278', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1753326.1753597', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1650083.1650092', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/956750.956767', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/2.666847', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1941884', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDM.2010.152']"

Historically, researchers have established a link between well-being and visibility of city neighbourhoods and have measured visibility via quantitative studies with willing participants, a process that is invariably manual and cumbersome. However, the influx of the world's population into urban centres now calls for methods that can easily be implemented, scaled, and analysed. We propose that one such method is offered by pervasive technology: we test whether urban mobility--as measured by public transport fare collection sensors--is a viable proxy for the visibility of a city's communities. We validate this hypothesis by examining the correlation between London urban flow of public transport and census-based indices of the well-being of London's census areas. We find that not only are the two correlated, but a number of insights into the flow between areas of varying social standing can be uncovered with readily available transport data. For example, we find that deprived areas tend to preferentially attract people living in other deprived areas, suggesting a segregation effect.",[]

The combination of mobile phones and recommender systems can change the way one deals with such abundance. Mobile phones with positioning technology are now widely available, making it easy for people to broadcast their whereabouts, recommender systems can now identify patterns in people’s movements in order to, for example, recommend events. To do so, the system relies on having mobile users who share their attendance at a large number of social events: cold-start users, who have no location history, cannot receive recommendations. We set out to address the mobile cold-start problem by answering the following research question: how can social events be recommended to a cold-start user based only on his home location? To answer this question, we carry out a study of the relationship between preferences for social events and geography, the first of its kind in a large metropolitan area. We sample location estimations of one million mobile phone users in Greater Boston, combine the sample with social events in the same area, and infer the social events attended by 2,519 residents. Upon this data, we test a variety of algorithms for recommending social events. We find that the most effective algorithm recommends events that are popular among residents of an area. The least effective, instead, recommends events that are geographically close to the area. This last result has interesting implications for location-based services that emphasize recommending nearby events.",[]

In this paper, we propose a framework (titled DRoF) that Discovers Regions of different Functions in a city using both human mobility among regions and points of interests (POIs) located in a region. Specifically, we segment a city into disjointed regions according to major roads, such as highways and urban express ways. We infer the functions of each region using a topic-based inference model, which regards a region as a document, a function as a topic, categories of POIs (e.g., restaurants and shopping malls) as metadata (like authors, affiliations, and key words), and human mobility patterns (when people reach/leave a region and where people come from and leave for) as words. As a result, a region is represented by a distribution of functions, and a function is featured by a distribution of mobility patterns. We further identify the intensity of each function in different locations. The results generated by our framework can benefit a variety of applications, including urban planning, location choosing for a business, and social recommendations. We evaluated our method using large-scale and real-world datasets, consisting of two POI datasets of Beijing (in 2010 and 2011) and two 3-month GPS trajectory datasets (representing human mobility) generated by over 12,000 taxicabs in Beijing in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The results justify the advantages of our approach over baseline methods solely using POIs or human mobility.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2133806.2133826', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/944919.944937', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020523', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1835804.1835918', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/34.161346', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020571', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2063212.2063223', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/558008', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1999320.1999331', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1963405.1963443', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020462', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2030112.2030128', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2030112.2030126', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2124413']"

This method promises to address some of the weaknesses in traditional collaborative filtering, while maintaining comparable accuracy. We validate our approach by predicting a subset of the Netflix data set.

Short-ranged travel is periodic both spatially and temporally and not effected by the social network structure, while long-distance travel is more influenced by social network ties.

Traditional recommender systems do not consider spatial properties of users nor items, LARS, on the other hand, supports a taxonomy of three novel classes of location-based ratings, namely, spatial ratings for non-spatial items, non-spatial ratings for spatial items, and spatial ratings for spatial items. LARS exploits user rating locations through user partitioning, a technique that influences recommendations with ratings spatially close to querying users in a manner that maximizes system scalability while not sacrificing recommendation quality. LARS exploits item locations using travel penalty, a technique that favors recommendation candidates closer in travel distance to querying users in a way that avoids exhaustive access to all spatial items. LARS can apply these techniques separately, or in concert, depending on the type of location-based rating available. Experimental evidence using large-scale real-world data from both the Foursquare location-based social network and the Movie Lens movie recommendation system reveals that LARS is efficient, scalable, and capable of producing recommendations twice as accurate compared to existing recommendation approaches.",[]

Many existing approaches to recommender systems can neither handle very large datasets nor easily deal with users who have made very few ratings or even none at all. Moreover, traditional recommender systems assume that all the users are independent and identically distributed; this assumption ignores the social interactions or connections among users. In view of the exponential growth of information generated by online social networks, social network analysis is becoming important for many Web applications. Following the intuition that a person's social network will affect personal behaviors on the Web, this paper proposes a factor analysis approach based on probabilistic matrix factorization to solve the data sparsity and poor prediction accuracy problems by employing both users' social network information and rating records. The complexity analysis indicates that our approach can be applied to very large datasets since it scales linearly with the number of observations, while the experimental results shows that our method performs much better than the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the circumstance that users have made few or no ratings.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1625275.1625706', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2074094.2074100', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/564376.564419', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/963770.963776', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988672.988727', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/312624.312682', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/860435.860483', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/963770.963774', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1008992.1009051', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MIC.2003.1167344', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1277741.1277751', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1102351.1102441', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192844.192905', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1390156.1390267', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2981562.2981720', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/371920.372071', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1367497.1367586', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1148170.1148257', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1076034.1076056', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1367497.1367517', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1277741.1277825']"

In addition to deriving user preference based on user-based collaborative filtering and exploring social influence from friends, we put a special emphasis on geographical influence due to the spatial clustering phenomenon exhibited in user check-in activities of LBSNs. We argue that the geographical influence among POIs plays an important role in user check-in behaviors and model it by power law distribution. Accordingly, we develop a collaborative recommendation algorithm based on geographical influence based on naive Bayesian. Furthermore, we propose a unified POI recommendation framework, which fuses user preference to a POI with social influence and geographical influence.

Experimental results with these real datasets show that the unified collaborative recommendation approach significantly outperforms a wide spectrum of alternative recommendation approaches.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TKDE.2005.99', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1367497.1367525', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/245108.245124', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/188490.188554', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645527.657311', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1162264', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/1920841.1920968', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/544220.544341', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/312624.312682', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/963770.963775', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1557019.1557067', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1571941.1571977', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1571941.1571978', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1639714.1639746', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1458082.1458205', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1935826.1935877', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/777092.777124', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/371920.372071', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDM.2006.70', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1148170.1148257', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869790.1869861', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1454008.1454031', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2898607.2898645', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1772690.1772795', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1526709.1526816']"

In this paper, we show that, by using the location data based on GPS and users' comments at various locations, we can discover interesting locations and possible activities that can be performed there for recommendations. Our research is highlighted in the following location-related queries in our daily life: 1) if we want to do something such as sightseeing or food-hunting in a large city such as Beijing, where should we go? 2) If we have already visited some places such as the Bird's Nest building in Beijing's Olympic park, what else can we do there? By using our system, for the first question, we can recommend her to visit a list of interesting locations such as Tiananmen Square, Bird's Nest, etc. For the second question, if the user visits Bird's Nest, we can recommend her to not only do sightseeing but also to experience its outdoor exercise facilities or try some nice food nearby. To achieve this goal, we first model the users' location and activity histories that we take as input. We then mine knowledge, such as the location features and activity-activity correlations from the geographical databases and the Web, to gather additional inputs. Finally, we apply a collective matrix factorization method to mine interesting locations and activities, and use them to recommend to the users where they can visit if they want to perform some specific activities and what they can do if they visit some specific places. We empirically evaluated our system using a large GPS dataset collected by 162 users over a period of 2.5 years in the real-world. We extensively evaluated our system and showed that our system can outperform several state-of-the-art baselines.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.artint.2007.01.006', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1367497.1367532', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1463434.1463477', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1394399', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1526709.1526816', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1148170.1148257', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1401890.1401969', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1242572.1242624', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1019194325861', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11833529_64', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2391319.2391438', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/SAINT.2006.55', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1619332.1619338', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/304182.304187', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1242572.1242831', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1620545.1620554', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1658373.1658374']"

In this article, we perform two types of travel recommendations by mining multiple users' GPS traces. The first is a generic one that recommends a user with top interesting locations and travel sequences in a given geospatial region. The second is a personalized recommendation that provides an individual with locations matching her travel preferences. To achieve the first recommendation, we model multiple users' location histories with a tree-based hierarchical graph (TBHG). Based on the TBHG, we propose a HITS (Hypertext Induced Topic Search)-based model to infer the interest level of a location and a user's travel experience (knowledge). In the personalized recommendation, we first understand the correlation between locations, and then incorporate this correlation into a collaborative filtering (CF)-based model, which predicts a user's interests in an unvisited location based on her locations histories and that of others. We evaluated our system based on a real-world GPS trace dataset collected by 107 users over a period of one year. As a result, our HITS-based inference model outperformed baseline approaches like rank-by-count and rank-by-frequency. Meanwhile, we achieved a better performance in recommending travel sequences beyond baselines like rank-by-count. Regarding the personalized recommendation, our approach is more effective than the weighted Slope One algorithm with a slightly additional computation, and is more efficient than the Pearson correlation-based CF model with the similar effectiveness.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1019194325861', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TKDE.2005.99', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00779-003-0240-0', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00779-006-0091-6', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1807167.1807197', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1341012.1341026', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00779-005-0046-3', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1281192.1281230', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/SAINT.2006.55', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11853565_15', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1463434.1463477', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1597148.1597206', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MIC.2003.1167344', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1014052.1014080', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2391319.2391438', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1242572.1242624', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11833529_64', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1772690.1772795', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1658373.1658374', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2009.50', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1409635.1409677', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1367497.1367532', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2008.20', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2010.42', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1526709.1526816', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1921591.1921596']"

Such real-world location histories imply, to some extent, users' interests in places, and bring us opportunities to understand the correlation between users and locations. In this article, we move towards this direction and report on a personalized friend and location recommender for the geographical information systems (GIS) on the Web. First, in this recommender system, a particular individual's visits to a geospatial region in the real world are used as their implicit ratings on that region. Second, we measure the similarity between users in terms of their location histories and recommend to each user a group of potential friends in a GIS community. Third, we estimate an individual's interests in a set of unvisited regions by involving his/her location history and those of other users. Some unvisited locations that might match their tastes can be recommended to the individual. A framework, referred to as a hierarchical-graph-based similarity measurement (HGSM), is proposed to uniformly model each individual's location history, and effectively measure the similarity among users. In this framework, we take into account three factors: 1) the sequence property of people's outdoor movements, 2) the visited popularity of a geospatial region, and 3) the hierarchical property of geographic spaces. Further, we incorporated a content-based method into a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm, which uses HGSM as the user similarity measure, to estimate the rating of a user on an item. We evaluated this recommender system based on the GPS data collected by 75 subjects over a period of 1 year in the real world. As a result, HGSM outperforms related similarity measures, namely similarity-by-count, cosine similarity, and Pearson similarity measures. Moreover, beyond the item-based CF method and random recommendations, our system provides users with more attractive locations and better user experiences of recommendation.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TKDE.2005.99', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/304182.304187', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00779-003-0240-0', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/371920.372071', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/245108.245124', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1297231.1297256', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2074094.2074100', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1807167.1807197', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1341012.1341026', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1242572.1242610', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/138859.138867', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1281192.1281230', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/315149.315352', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/860435.860483', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/SAINT.2006.55', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/582415.582418', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11853565_15', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MC.2007.141', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ipm.2006.07.005', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1463434.1463477', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1597148.1597206', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MIC.2003.1167344', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1463434.1463477', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/777092.777124', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645527.657289', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1006544522159', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/192844.192905', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/223904.223931', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1081870.1081956', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11833529_64', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1297231.1297265', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/11853565_13', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2008.24', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1244468.1244610', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1772690.1772795', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2010.42', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1889681.1889683', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1658373.1658374', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2009.50', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1409635.1409677', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1367497.1367532', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2008.20', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1526709.1526816']"

We then describe and analyze an efficient algorithm called RankBoost for combining preferences based on the boosting approach to machine learning. We give theoretical results describing the algorithm's behavior both on the training data, and on new test data not seen during training. We also describe an efficient implementation of the algorithm for a particular restricted but common case. We next discuss two experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost.

It is argued that evaluation methods should credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This is desirable from the user point of view in modern large IR environments. The proposed methods are (1) a novel application of P-R curves and average precision computations based on separate recall bases for documents of different degrees of relevance, and (2) two novel measures computing the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. We then demonstrate the use of these evaluation methods in a case study on the effectiveness of query types, based on combinations of query structures and expansion, in retrieving documents of various degrees of relevance. The test was run with a best match retrieval system (In-Query1) in a text database consisting of newspaper articles. The results indicate that the tested strong query structures are most effective in retrieving highly relevant documents. The differences between the query types are practically essential and statistically significant. More generally, the novel evaluation methods and the case demonstrate that non-dichotomous relevance assessments are applicable in IR experiments, may reveal interesting phenomena, and allow harder testing of IR methods.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3166.3197', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/290941.291019', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/209015.209017', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1108/eb026869', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1009983401464', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/290941.290978', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/291198', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/208114.208117', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/0306-4573(94)90065-5', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/125355']"

A controlled study using three classifiers, kNN, LLSF and WORD, was conducted to examine the impact of configuration variations in five versions of Reuters on the observed performance of classifiers. Analysis and empirical evidence suggest that the evaluation results on some versions of Reuters were significantly affected by the inclusion of a large portion of unlabelled documents, mading those results difficult to interpret and leading to considerable confusions in the literature. Using the results evaluated on the other versions of Reuters which exclude the unlabelled documents, the performance of twelve methods are compared directly or indirectly. For indirect compararions, kNN, LLSF and WORD were used as baselines, since they were evaluated on all versions of Reuters that exclude the unlabelled documents. As a global observation, kNN, LLSF and a neural network method had the best performance; except for a Naive Bayes approach, the other learning algorithms also performed relatively well.",[]

We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems.

When this approach is used to solve graph-search problems with unit edge costs, we show that a breadth-first search strategy can be more memory-efficient than a best-first strategy. We also show that a breadth-first strategy allows a technique for preventing node regeneration that is easier to implement and can be applied more widely. The breadth-first heuristic search algorithms introduced in this paper include a memory-efficient implementation of breadth-first branch-and-bound search and a breadth-first iterative-deepening A* algorithm that is based on it.

Once planned, there are many possible events that can affect the plan, such as schedule changes or flight cancellations, and checking for these possible events requires time and effort. In this paper, we describe how Heracles and Theseus, two information gathering and monitoring tools that we built, can be used to simplify this process. Heracles is a hierarchical constraint planner that aids in interactive itinerary development by showing how a particular choice (e.g., destination airport) affects other choices (e.g., possible modes of transportation, available airlines, etc.). Heracles builds on an information agent platform, called Theseus, that provides the technology for efficiently executing agents for information gathering and monitoring tasks.

However, corporations change prices based on proprietary algorithms and hidden variables (e.g., the number of unsold seats on a flight). Is it possible to develop data mining techniques that will enable consumers to predict price changes under these conditions?This paper reports on a pilot study in the domain of airline ticket prices where we recorded over 12,000 price observations over a 41 day period. When trained on this data, Hamlet --- our multi-strategy data mining algorithm --- generated a predictive model that saved 341 simulated passengers $198,074 by advising them when to buy and when to postpone ticket purchases. Remarkably, a clairvoyant algorithm with complete knowledge of future prices could save at most $320,572 in our simulation, thus HAMLET's savings were 61.8% of optimal. The algorithm's savings of $198,074 represents an average savings of 23.8% for the 341 passengers for whom savings are possible. Overall, HAMLET saved 4.4% of the ticket price averaged over the entire set of 4,488 simulated passengers.

Collaborative filtering is one technique among many information filtering techniques that range from unfiltered to personalized and from effortless to laborious. Libraries or the Web are good examples of unfiltered information sources. E-mail directed to one recipient is a good example of a filtered information source. A best-seller list requires little effort fur the user, but provides the same recommendations to all users. Filters based on demographics, such as age, sex, or marital status, require some effort from the user in providing the demographics, and provide some level of personal filtering, so they are near the middle of the chart. Collaborative filtering requires relatively little effort from the user, and provides individually targeted recommendations, so it is in the upper right of the chart. Effort, of course, can be reduced via automation. While collaborative filtering is not necessarily effortless, it requires a relatively small amount of effort on the part of the user and provides very individualized recommendations.

The combination of mobile phones and recommender systems can change the way one deals with such abundance. Mobile phones with positioning technology are now widely available, making it easy for people to broadcast their whereabouts, recommender systems can now identify patterns in people’s movements in order to, for example, recommend events. To do so, the system relies on having mobile users who share their attendance at a large number of social events: cold-start users, who have no location history, cannot receive recommendations. We set out to address the mobile cold-start problem by answering the following research question: how can social events be recommended to a cold-start user based only on his home location? To answer this question, we carry out a study of the relationship between preferences for social events and geography, the first of its kind in a large metropolitan area. We sample location estimations of one million mobile phone users in Greater Boston, combine the sample with social events in the same area, and infer the social events attended by 2,519 residents. Upon this data, we test a variety of algorithms for recommending social events. We find that the most effective algorithm recommends events that are popular among residents of an area. The least effective, instead, recommends events that are geographically close to the area. This last result has interesting implications for location-based services that emphasize recommending nearby events.",[]

However, extracting green knowledge from location traces is not a trivial task. Conventional data analysis tools are usually not customized for handling the massive quantity, complex, dynamic, and distributed nature of location traces. To that end, in this paper, we provide a focused study of extracting energy-efficient transportation patterns from location traces. Specifically, we have the initial focus on a sequence of mobile recommendations. As a case study, we develop a mobile recommender system which has the ability in recommending a sequence of pick-up points for taxi drivers or a sequence of potential parking positions. The goal of this mobile recommendation system is to maximize the probability of business success. Along this line, we provide a Potential Travel Distance (PTD) function for evaluating each candidate sequence. This PTD function possesses a monotone property which can be used to effectively prune the search space. Based on this PTD function, we develop two algorithms, LCP and SkyRoute, for finding the recommended routes. Finally, experimental results show that the proposed system can provide effective mobile sequential recommendation and the knowledge extracted from location traces can be used for coaching drivers and leading to the efficient use of energy.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1019194325861', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TKDE.2005.99', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1374811', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/UBICOMM.2008.16', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1219755.1219764', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/332040.332047', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.39.1.115', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1061318.1061320', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TSMCB.2002.805812', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645927.672217', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/604045.604094', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1006544522159', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645484.656550', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1653771.1653840', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/381461.381466', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICMB.2005.68']"

GPS-associated documents become popular with the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies. For example, in Flickr, the geo-tagged photos are associated with tags and GPS locations. In Twitter, the locations of the tweets can be identified by the GPS locations from smart phones. Many interesting concepts, including cultures, scenes, and product sales, correspond to specialized geographical distributions. In this paper, we are interested in two questions: (1) how to discover different topics of interests that are coherent in geographical regions? (2) how to compare several topics across different geographical locations? To answer these questions, this paper proposes and compares three ways of modeling geographical topics: location-driven model, text-driven model, and a novel joint model called LGTA (Latent Geographical Topic Analysis) that combines location and text. To make a fair comparison, we collect several representative datasets from Flickr website including Landscape, Activity, Manhattan, National park, Festival, Car, and Food. The results show that the first two methods work in some datasets but fail in others. LGTA works well in all these datasets at not only finding regions of interests but also providing effective comparisons of the topics across different locations.

In this system, GPS-equipped taxicabs are employed as mobile sensors constantly probing the traffic rhythm of a city and taxi drivers' intelligence in choosing driving directions in the physical world. Meanwhile, a Cloud aggregates and mines the information from these taxis and other sources from the Internet, like Web maps and weather forecast. The Cloud builds a model incorporating day of the week, time of day, weather conditions, and individual driving strategies (both of the taxi drivers and of the end user for whom the route is being computed). Using this model, our system predicts the traffic conditions of a future time (when the computed route is actually driven) and performs a self-adaptive driving direction service for a particular user. This service gradually learns a user's driving behavior from the user's GPS logs and customizes the fastest route for the user with the help of the Cloud. We evaluate our service using a real-world dataset generated by over 33,000 taxis over a period of 3 months in Beijing. As a result, our service accurately estimates the travel time of a route for a user; hence finding the fastest route customized for the user.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.eswa.2008.07.069', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/73944', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/S0747-7171(08)80013-2', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1353343.1353371', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/38.844372', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1835804.1835918', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1325851.1325942', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICDE.2006.71', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1597122.1597139', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/3468.594911', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1653771.1653820', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1764967.1765070', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/79147.214078', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1644038.1644048', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869790.1869807', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2010.14', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2009.50']"

First, this recommender provides taxi drivers with some locations and the routes to these locations, towards which they are more likely to pick up passengers quickly (during the routes or at these locations) and maximize the profit. Second, it recommends people with some locations (within a walking distance) where they can easily find vacant taxis. In our method, we learn the above knowledge (represented by probabilities) from GPS trajectories of taxis. Then, we feed the knowledge into a probabilistic model which estimates the profit of the candidate locations for a particular driver based on where and when the driver requests for the recommendation. We validate our recommender using historical trajectories generated by over 12,000 taxis during 110 days.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/304182.304187', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A:1018054314350', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1835804.1835918', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/582415.582418', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1926743.1926752', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2035253.2035273', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1361684.1361686', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-540-85565-1_69', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869790.1869807', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MDM.2010.14']"

In this paper we detect flawed urban planning using the GPS trajectories of taxicabs traveling in urban areas. The detected results consist of 1) pairs of regions with salient traffic problems and 2) the linking structure as well as correlation among them. These results can evaluate the effectiveness of the carried out planning, such as a newly built road and subway lines in a city, and remind city planners of a problem that has not been recognized when they conceive future plans. We conduct our method using the trajectories generated by 30,000 taxis from March to May in 2009 and 2010 in Beijing, and evaluate our results with the real urban planning of Beijing.","['https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/645484.656550', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1864349.1864380', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00779-005-0046-3', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/CSE.2009.91', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1835804.1835918', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MPRV.2007.57', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1463434.1463477', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/321556.321570', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MC.2006.308', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869790.1869807', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1409635.1409678', 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1921591.1921596']"
